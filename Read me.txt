1. Description:
   - This is a Python script that lets you play an interactive game where you guess the name of a movie. The script randomly selects a 
     movie name from a predefined list. First, you need to input your name to start the game. Once you're in, you'll have to guess the 
     letters of the movie name. You have only 12 chances to guess the correct letters.

2. Gameplay:
   - Movie Selection:
     A movie name will be selected randomly from a list of movie names.

   - Player Details:
     Players are prompted to input their names. 
     A welcome message is displayed, outlining the objective of the game and the number of turns available (12).

   - Game Loop:
     The game is contained within a while loop that will continue until the player either guesses the entire movie name correctly or 
     exhausts all chances.

   - Display Movie Name:
     The selected movie name is iterated through letter by letter. 
     If the player has guessed a letter, it is revealed. Otherwise, an underscore is displayed.

   - Guess Input:
     Players are prompted to enter a letter as their guess.

   - Update Player Guesses:
     After the player makes a guess, their guess is added to the string of previous guesses made by the player.

   - Check Guess Validity:
     If the player guesses a letter not in the movie name, they lose a chance.

   - Game Over Condition:
     If the player uses up all chances (chances == 0), the game ends and displays a "Game Over" message.

   - Game Victory Condition:
     If the player guesses all letters correctly, they will see a congratulatory message along with the revealed movie name.
